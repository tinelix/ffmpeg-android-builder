@chapter Encoders
@c man begin ENCODERS

Encoders are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow the encoding of
multimedia streams.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported native encoders
are enabled by default. Encoders requiring an external library must be enabled
manually via the corresponding @code{--enable-lib} option. You can list all
available encoders using the configure option @code{--list-encoders}.

You can disable all the encoders with the configure option
@code{--disable-encoders} and selectively enable / disable single encoders
with the options @code{--enable-encoder=@var{ENCODER}} /
@code{--disable-encoder=@var{ENCODER}}.

The option @code{-codecs} of the ff* tools will display the list of
enabled encoders.

@chapter Audio Encoders
@c man begin AUDIO ENCODERS

A description of some of the currently available audio encoders
follows.

@anchor{aacenc}
@section aac

Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) encoder.

This encoder is an experimental FFmpeg-native AAC encoder. Currently only the
low complexity (AAC-LC) profile is supported. To use this encoder, you must set
@option{strict} option to @samp{experimental} or lower.

As this encoder is experimental, unexpected behavior may exist from time to
time. For a more stable AAC encoder, see @ref{libvo-aacenc}. However, be warned
that it has a worse quality reported by some users.

@c Comment this out until somebody writes the respective documentation.
@c See also @ref{libfaac}, @ref{libaacplus}, and @ref{libfdk-aac-enc}.

@subsection Options

@table @option
@item b
Set bit rate in bits/s. Setting this automatically activates constant bit rate
(CBR) mode.

@item q
Set quality for variable bit rate (VBR) mode. This option is valid only using
the @command{ffmpeg} command-line tool. For library interface users, use
@option{global_quality}.

@item stereo_mode
Set stereo encoding mode. Possible values:

@table @samp
@item auto
Automatically selected by the encoder.

@item ms_off
Disable middle/side encoding. This is the default.

@item ms_force
Force middle/side encoding.
@end table

@item aac_coder
Set AAC encoder coding method. Possible values:

@table @samp
@item 0
FAAC-inspired method.

This method is a simplified reimplementation of the method used in FAAC, which
sets thresholds proportional to the band energies, and then decreases all the
thresholds with quantizer steps to find the appropriate quantization with
distortion below threshold band by band.

The quality of this method is comparable to the two loop searching method
descibed below, but somewhat a little better and slower.

@item 1
Average noise to mask ratio (ANMR) trellis-based solution.

This has a theoretic best quality out of all the coding methods, but at the
cost of the slowest speed.

@item 2
Two loop searching (TLS) method.

This method first sets quantizers depending on band thresholds and then tries
to find an optimal combination by adding or subtracting a specific value from
all quantizers and adjusting some individual quantizer a little.

This method produces similar quality with the FAAC method and is the default.

@item 3
Constant quantizer method.

This method sets a constant quantizer for all bands. This is the fastest of all
the methods, yet produces the worst quality.

@end table

@end table

@subsection Tips and Tricks

According to some reports
(e.g. @url{http://d.hatena.ne.jp/kamedo2/20120729/1343545890}), setting the
@option{cutoff} option to 15000 Hz greatly improves the quality of the output
quality. As a result, we encourage you to do the same.

@section ac3 and ac3_fixed

AC-3 audio encoders.

These encoders implement part of ATSC A/52:2010 and ETSI TS 102 366, as well as
the undocumented RealAudio 3 (a.k.a. dnet).

The @var{ac3} encoder uses floating-point math, while the @var{ac3_fixed}
encoder only uses fixed-point integer math. This does not mean that one is
always faster, just that one or the other may be better suited to a
particular system. The floating-point encoder will generally produce better
quality audio for a given bitrate. The @var{ac3_fixed} encoder is not the
default codec for any of the output formats, so it must be specified explicitly
using the option @code{-acodec ac3_fixed} in order to use it.

@subsection AC-3 Metadata

The AC-3 metadata options are used to set parameters that describe the audio,
but in most cases do not affect the audio encoding itself. Some of the options
do directly affect or influence the decoding and playback of the resulting
bitstream, while others are just for informational purposes. A few of the
options will add bits to the output stream that could otherwise be used for
audio data, and will thus affect the quality of the output. Those will be
indicated accordingly with a note in the option list below.

These parameters are described in detail in several publicly-available
documents.

@subsubsection Audio Production Information
Audio Production Information is optional information describing the mixing
environment.  Either none or both of the fields are written to the bitstream.

@table @option

@item -mixing_level @var{number}
Mixing Level. Specifies peak sound pressure level (SPL) in the production
environment when the mix was mastered. Valid values are 80 to 111, or -1 for
unknown or not indicated. The default value is -1, but that value cannot be
used if the Audio Production Information is written to the bitstream. Therefore,
if the @code{room_type} option is not the default value, the @code{mixing_level}
option must not be -1.

@item -room_type @var{type}
Room Type. Describes the equalization used during the final mixing session at
the studio or on the dubbing stage. A large room is a dubbing stage with the
industry standard X-curve equalization; a small room has flat equalization.
This field will not be written to the bitstream if both the @code{mixing_level}
option and the @code{room_type} option have the default values.

@subsection Extended Bitstream Information
The extended bitstream options are part of the Alternate Bit Stream Syntax as
specified in Annex D of the A/52:2010 standard. It is grouped into 2 parts.
If any one parameter in a group is specified, all values in that group will be
written to the bitstream.  Default values are used for those that are written
but have not been specified.  If the mixing levels are written, the decoder
will use these values instead of the ones specified in the @code{center_mixlev}
and @code{surround_mixlev} options if it supports the Alternate Bit Stream
Syntax.

@subsection Other AC-3 Encoding Options

@table @option

@item -stereo_rematrixing @var{boolean}
Stereo Rematrixing. Enables/Disables use of rematrixing for stereo input. This
is an optional AC-3 feature that increases quality by selectively encoding
the left/right channels as mid/side. This option is enabled by default, and it
is highly recommended that it be left as enabled except for testing purposes.

@end table

@subsection Floating-Point-Only AC-3 Encoding Options

These options are only valid for the floating-point encoder and do not exist
for the fixed-point encoder due to the corresponding features not being
implemented in fixed-point.

@table @option

@item -channel_coupling @var{boolean}
Enables/Disables use of channel coupling, which is an optional AC-3 feature
that increases quality by combining high frequency information from multiple
channels into a single channel. The per-channel high frequency information is
sent with less accuracy in both the frequency and time domains. This allows
more bits to be used for lower frequencies while preserving enough information
to reconstruct the high frequencies. This option is enabled by default for the
floating-point encoder and should generally be left as enabled except for
testing purposes or to increase encoding speed.

value higher than the bandwidth is used, it will be reduced to 1 less than the
coupling end band. If @var{auto} is used, the start band will be determined by
the encoder based on the bit rate, sample rate, and channel layout. This option
has no effect if channel coupling is disabled.

@c man begin VIDEO ENCODERS

A description of some of the currently available video encoders
follows.

@section libtheora

Theora format supported through libtheora.

Requires the presence of the libtheora headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
@code{--enable-libtheora}.

@subsection Options

The following global options are mapped to internal libtheora options
which affect the quality and the bitrate of the encoded stream.

@table @option
@item b
Set the video bitrate, only works if the @code{qscale} flag in
@option{flags} is not enabled.

@item flags
Used to enable constant quality mode encoding through the
@option{qscale} flag, and to enable the @code{pass1} and @code{pass2}
modes.

@item g
Set the GOP size.

@item global_quality
Set the global quality in lambda units, only works if the
@code{qscale} flag in @option{flags} is enabled. The value is clipped
in the [0 - 10*@code{FF_QP2LAMBDA}] range, and then multiplied for 6.3
to get a value in the native libtheora range [0-63]. A higher value
corresponds to a higher quality.

For example, to set maximum constant quality encoding with
@command{ffmpeg}:
@example
ffmpeg -i INPUT -flags:v qscale -global_quality:v "10*QP2LAMBDA" -codec:v libtheora OUTPUT.ogg

@section libx264

H.264 / AVC / MPEG-4 AVC / MPEG-4 part 10 format supported through
libx264.

Requires the presence of the libx264 headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
@code{--enable-libx264}.

@subsection Options

@table @option

@item preset @var{preset_name}
Set the encoding preset.

@item tune @var{tune_name}
Tune the encoding params.

@item fastfirstpass @var{bool}
Use fast settings when encoding first pass, default value is 1.

@item profile @var{profile_name}
Set profile restrictions.

@item level @var{level}
Specify level (as defined by Annex A).
Deprecated in favor of @var{x264opts}.

@item passlogfile @var{filename}
Specify filename for 2 pass stats.
Deprecated in favor of @var{x264opts} (see @var{stats} libx264 option).

@item wpredp @var{wpred_type}
Specify Weighted prediction for P-frames.
Deprecated in favor of @var{x264opts} (see @var{weightp} libx264 option).

@item x264opts @var{options}
Allow to set any x264 option, see @code{x264 --fullhelp} for a list.

@var{options} is a list of @var{key}=@var{value} couples separated by
":". In @var{filter} and @var{psy-rd} options that use ":" as a separator
themselves, use "," instead. They accept it as well since long ago but this
is kept undocumented for some reason.
@end table

For example to specify libx264 encoding options with @command{ffmpeg}:
@example
ffmpeg -i foo.mpg -vcodec libx264 -x264opts keyint=123:min-keyint=20 -an out.mkv
@end example

For more information about libx264 and the supported options see:

@section libxvid

Xvid MPEG-4 Part 2 encoder wrapper.

This encoder requires the presence of the libxvidcore headers and library
during configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
@code{--enable-libxvid --enable-gpl}.

The native @code{mpeg4} encoder supports the MPEG-4 Part 2 format, so
users can encode to this format without this library.

@subsection Options

The following options are supported by the libxvid wrapper. Some of
the following options are listed but are not documented, and
correspond to shared codec options. See @ref{codec-options,,the Codec
Options chapter} for their documentation. The other shared options
which are not listed have no effect for the libxvid encoder.

@table @option
@item b

@item g

@item qmin

@item qmax

@item mpeg_quant

@item threads

@item bf

@item b_qfactor

@item b_qoffset

@item flags
Set specific encoding flags. Possible values:

@table @samp

@item mv4
Use four motion vector by macroblock.

@item aic
Enable high quality AC prediction.

@item gray
Only encode grayscale.

@item gmc
Enable the use of global motion compensation (GMC).

@item qpel
Enable quarter-pixel motion compensation.

@item cgop
Enable closed GOP.

@item global_header
Place global headers in extradata instead of every keyframe.

@end table

@item trellis

@item me_method
Set motion estimation method. Possible values in decreasing order of
speed and increasing order of quality:

@table @samp
@item zero
Use no motion estimation (default).

@item phods
@item x1
@item log
Enable advanced diamond zonal search for 16x16 blocks and half-pixel
refinement for 16x16 blocks. @samp{x1} and @samp{log} are aliases for
@samp{phods}.

@item epzs
Enable all of the things described above, plus advanced diamond zonal
search for 8x8 blocks, half-pixel refinement for 8x8 blocks, and motion
estimation on chroma planes.

@item full
Enable all of the things described above, plus extended 16x16 and 8x8
blocks search.
@end table

@item mbd
Set macroblock decision algorithm. Possible values in the increasing
order of quality:

@table @samp
@item simple
Use macroblock comparing function algorithm (default).

@item bits
Enable rate distortion-based half pixel and quarter pixel refinement for
16x16 blocks.

@item rd
Enable all of the things described above, plus rate distortion-based
half pixel and quarter pixel refinement for 8x8 blocks, and rate
distortion-based search using square pattern.
